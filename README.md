# 🎮 Visual Novel Engine (Work in Progress)

**Visual Novel Engine** is a personal Java project aiming to create a modular, lightweight engine for building text-based or 2D visual novel games.

Currently in early development — the goal is to design a clean, extendable structure that will later support:
- 🧩 scenes and story progression
- 💬 dialogue choices and branching paths
- 🪟 a custom text window UI (replacing the console)
- 🎨 future 2D and visual layer support
- 🧠 character and story management systems

## 💡 Vision
The long-term idea is to evolve this engine from a simple console-based framework  
into a full **2D visual novel platform**, capable of supporting both story scripting and basic RPG mechanics.
