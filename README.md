# 🎮 Visual Novel Engine

**Visual Novel Engine** is a personal Java project driven by a simple idea —  
to craft a **clean, modular and immersive engine** for building text-based or 2D visual novel games.

It’s a foundation for interactive storytelling —  
focused on structure, clarity and atmosphere rather than complexity.  
Every element, from the dialogue flow to story management,  
is designed to evolve naturally as the project grows.

The long-term vision is to turn this framework into a **complete visual novel platform**,  
capable of supporting:
- branching dialogue and player choices,  
- dynamic 2D and audio layers,  
- character systems and scripted story logic,  
- and the creative freedom to build stories entirely in Java.

A story engine made for storytellers — lightweight, personal, and endlessly expandable.
